# Problem 1

Importing and cleaning data tables: This
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv` dataset contains
information related to entrance and exit conditions for each subway
stations in NYC. The dataset contains character variables, double class
variables which holds double-precision floating point numbers, and
logical variables. To clean-up the dataset, firstly I need to import the
data. Then I used `janitor::clean_names` function to clean up variable
names. The next step is to select variables and discard others using
`select` function. I also changed the data type of route 8-11 into
character for consistency with route 1-7. In order to convert one
variable from character to logical variable, I mutate the character
variables of “YES and NO” into logical conditions `TRUE and FALSE`.

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, `YES` = TRUE, `NO` = FALSE))
```

Currently the dimension of dateset is 1868\*19, which has 1868 rows and
19 columns. But the dataset is not tidy yet, we can modify the route
1-11 columns from wide to long format to make them become variables in a
single column.

To find distinct stations from transit_df dataset, we can use `distinct`
function to summarize all distinct variable combinations and then count
number of rows in the new dataset.

``` r
dist_station = nrow(distinct(transit_df, station_name, line))
```

*We can tell that there are 465 distinct stations.*

Then, we would like to know how many distinct stations are ADA
compliant. It’s similar with previous question but this time the data we
want must satisfy the condition that `ada == TRUE`, so we can use
`filter` function to select data that satisfy the condition and find
`distinct` combinations from these data. Lastly, we also need to use
`nrow` to count for numbers of distinct combinations.

``` r
ada_compliant = nrow(distinct(filter(transit_df, ada == TRUE), station_name, line))
```

*We find that 84 stations are ADA compliant.*

In order to calculate the proportion of station entrances / exits
without vending allow entrance, we need to use the number of stations
`without vending allow entrance` divided by number of stations
`without vending`. Also, I’ll use filter function to create constraints.

``` r
entrance_without_vending = nrow(filter(transit_df, vending == "NO", entry == TRUE))
proportion = entrance_without_vending / nrow(filter(transit_df, vending == "NO"))
```

*In conclusion, 0.38 (rounded by 2 decimal places) of station entrances
/ exits without vending allow entrance.*

Lastly, I’m going to use `pivot_longer` function to transform route
number and route name into distinct variables with long format. After
modifying route name and value, I’ll `filter` the `distinct` stations
that satisfy `route == "A"` condition for distinct stations serve the A
train and `filter` the `distinct` stations that satisfy `route == "A"`
and `ada == TRUE` condition for ADA compliant stations that serve A
train.

``` r
pivot_longer(
    transit_df,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>%
  filter(route == "A") %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    line            station_name
