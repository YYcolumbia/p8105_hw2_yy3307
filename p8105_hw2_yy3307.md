# Problem 1

Importing and cleaning data tables: This
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv` dataset contains
information related to entrance and exit conditions for each subway
stations in NYC. The dataset contains character variables, double class
variables which holds double-precision floating point numbers, and
logical variables. To clean-up the dataset, firstly I need to import the
data. Then I used `janitor::clean_names` function to clean up variable
names. The next step is to select variables and discard others using
`select` function. I also changed the data type of route 8-11 into
character for consistency with route 1-7. In order to convert one
variable from character to logical variable, I mutate the character
variables of “YES and NO” into logical conditions `TRUE and FALSE`.

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, `YES` = TRUE, `NO` = FALSE))
```

Currently the dimension of dateset is 1868\*19, which has 1868 rows and
19 columns. But the dataset is not tidy yet, we can modify the route
1-11 columns from wide to long format to make them become variables in a
single column.

To find distinct stations from transit_df dataset, we can use `distinct`
function to summarize all distinct variable combinations and then count
number of rows in the new dataset.

``` r
dist_station = nrow(distinct(transit_df, station_name, line))
```

*We can tell that there are 465 distinct stations.*

Then, we would like to know how many distinct stations are ADA
compliant. It’s similar with previous question but this time the data we
want must satisfy the condition that `ada == TRUE`, so we can use
`filter` function to select data that satisfy the condition and find
`distinct` combinations from these data. Lastly, we also need to use
`nrow` to count for numbers of distinct combinations.

``` r
ada_compliant = nrow(distinct(filter(transit_df, ada == TRUE), station_name, line))
```

*We find that 84 stations are ADA compliant.*

In order to calculate the proportion of station entrances / exits
without vending allow entrance, we need to use the number of stations
`without vending allow entrance` divided by number of stations
`without vending`. Also, I’ll use filter function to create constraints.

``` r
entrance_without_vending = nrow(filter(transit_df, vending == "NO", entry == TRUE))
proportion = entrance_without_vending / nrow(filter(transit_df, vending == "NO"))
```

*In conclusion, 0.38 (rounded by 2 decimal places) of station entrances
/ exits without vending allow entrance.*

Lastly, I’m going to use `pivot_longer` function to transform route
number and route name into distinct variables with long format. After
modifying route name and value, I’ll `filter` the `distinct` stations
that satisfy `route == "A"` condition for distinct stations serve the A
train and `filter` the `distinct` stations that satisfy `route == "A"`
and `ada == TRUE` condition for ADA compliant stations that serve A
train.

``` r
pivot_longer(
    transit_df,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>%
  filter(route == "A") %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    line            station_name                 
    ##    <chr>           <chr>

``` r

# Problem 2

To tidy `Mr. Trash Wheel` and `Professor Trash Wheel` datasets, firstly
we need to import and clean the
`data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx` dataset, the table is
in excel format so we need to call `readxl` from library. To eliminate
rows with figure and notes, we can directly select desired data range
from excel sheet. After cleaning column variable names, we’ll use
`drop_na` to omit rows that no not include `dumpster` data. Then, we
need to `mutate` the `sports_ball` variable into integers and `round`
them to the nearest integer. Lastly, I added a data column of
`data_source` to keep track the source of data.

``` r
trash_df =
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N534") %>%
  mutate(data_source = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>%
  select(data_source, everything()) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
  )

pro_trash_df =
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N117") %>%
  mutate(data_source = "Professor Trash Wheel") %>%
  select(data_source, everything()) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
  )
```

After cleaning both datasets, I’m going to combine these two datasets to
produce a single tidy dataset. In order to keep all important
information from both datasets, I’ll use `full_join` for combination.

``` r
combine_trash_df = full_join(trash_df, pro_trash_df)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("data_source", "dumpster", "month", "year", "date",
    ## "weight_tons", "volume_cubic_yards", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene",
    ## "cigarette_butts", "glass_bottles", "grocery_bags", "chip_bags",
    ## "sports_balls", "homes_powered")

After combination, we get a 524\*15 tidy dataset, including
`data_source, dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered`.
Specifically, we observed 453 groups of data for Mr. Trash Wheel from
May 2014 to January 2021, and 71 observations for Professor Trash Wheel
from January 2017 to January 2021. Using this dataset, we can easily
find total numbers of any trash collections that we’re interested in.
For instance, the total number of glass bottles collected by Professor
Trash Wheel is 842. Or we can find the mean value of specific sampled
data, such as the mean value of polystyrene collection for Mr. Trash
Wheel in May is 2136.25.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 135.5
tons. And the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel
in 2020 is 856.
